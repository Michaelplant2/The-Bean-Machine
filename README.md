# The-Bean-Machine
 
In this portfolio project, you'll build a minimal landing page for an coffee bean shop.

This mockup has 4 main parts: the navigation, banner, main section and the footer.

## Getting Started Notes

- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag, so you don't have to worry about that. 
  
- Note about the layout: focus primarily on the flow-layout and box-model. It's important to be comfortable with these primitives (padding, border and margin) before moving on to more-complex subjects.

  

- **Pay close attention to** using the right HTML markup: Make sure you use the [markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your HTML structure.

## Design tokens

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, that's why we use _design tokens_.


**If you find it difficult to use these tokens, or if you're not able to achieve a result you're happy with, don't worry about it.** 

### Spacing

This landing page uses an 8px unit. This will help you to determine the size of padding and margin. Start with 16px and then adjust if you want more space (24px and up) or less (8px)

- `8px`
- `16px`
- `24px`
- `32px`
- `48px`
- `64px`
- `96px`
- `128px`

When it comes to max widths (eg. the maximum width of the card), arbitrary values can be used.

### Font

2 font is used in this project: `Lato` and `Open Sans`. It is already included in the stylesheet.

The base font size is 16px, which reflect the typography in the following:

- `<h1>` - `40px`
- `<h2>` - `36px`
- `<p>` - `16px`

### Color palette

Primary (pink):

- `#FF5678`

Secondary (green):

- `#149770`

Grays:

- `#1D1C1C` (black)
- `#917D6E` (dark gray)
- `#F6F2EF` (medium gray)
- `#FFFFFF` (white)

> What the HEX Code?
>A color hex code is a hexadecimal way to represent a color in RGB format by combining three values â€“ the amounts of red, green and blue in a particular shade of color.
> These color hex codes have been an integral part of HTML for web design, and remain a key way of representing color formats digitally.
